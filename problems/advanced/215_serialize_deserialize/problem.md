# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Source:** custom  
**ID:** 215

## Problem Description

Work with tree data structures to solve this problem.

### Task

Given a binary tree, solve Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [tree representation]
Output: [result]
Explanation: [tree traversal explanation]
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [tree representation]
Output: [result]
Explanation: [tree traversal explanation]
```

## Constraints

- Number of nodes in range `[0, 10^4]`
- Node values are within reasonable range
- Tree may be empty

## Approach

### Key Insights

1. Choose appropriate traversal method
2. Consider recursive vs iterative approach
3. Handle edge cases (empty tree, single node)

### Algorithm

1. Handle base cases
2. Apply recursive logic or iterative traversal
3. Process nodes according to problem requirements
4. Return computed result

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is number of nodes
- **Space Complexity:** O(h) where h is tree height
