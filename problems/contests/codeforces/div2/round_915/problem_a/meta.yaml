solution_approaches:
  - "name: "Pattern Recognition"
time_complexity: "O(sqrt(n))"
space_complexity: "O(1)"
description: "Full game theory analysis for understanding"
key_insights:
  - "Game theory pattern: Alice wins except for powers of 2 > 2"
  - "Odd numbers always favor Alice (subtract 1 strategy)"
  - "Even non-power-of-2 numbers favor Alice"
  - "Powers of 2 > 2 are losing positions for Alice"
common_mistakes:
  - "Overthinking the game theory"
  - "Not recognizing the simple pattern"
  - "Trying to implement full game tree"
  - "Missing edge cases for small numbers"
learning_objectives:
  - "Understand basic game theory concepts"
  - "Practice pattern recognition in competitive programming"
  - "Learn to identify mathematical structures in games"
contest_strategy:
  - "Quick pattern recognition is key"
  - "Test small values to find pattern"
  - "Implement simple check for powers of 2"
  - "Avoid overcomplicating the solution"
