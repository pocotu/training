solution_approaches:
  - "name: "Dynamic Programming"
time_complexity: "O(nÂ²)"
space_complexity: "O(1)"
description: "Catalan number variation with constraints"
key_insights:
  - "Track balance (open_count - close_count) as DP state"
  - "Balance must never go negative and must end at 0"
  - "Related to Catalan numbers but with position constraints"
  - "Memoization on (position, balance) provides optimal substructure"
common_mistakes:
  - "Not handling negative balance constraint"
  - "Forgetting that final balance must be 0"
  - "Inefficient state space (too many dimensions)"
  - "Not considering that only even-length strings can be valid"
learning_objectives:
  - "Master DP with constraint tracking"
  - "Understand Catalan number applications"
  - "Practice complex state space optimization"
  - "Learn mathematical counting techniques"
contest_strategy:
  - "Start with recursive solution to understand states"
  - "Add memoization for efficiency"
  - "Consider mathematical shortcuts for simple cases"
  - "Validate with small examples first"
mathematical_background:
  - "Catalan numbers: C_n = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!)"
  - "Valid parentheses strings of length 2n: C_n"
  - "Constraint adds complexity beyond pure Catalan"
