# 4. Count Valid Parentheses Permutations

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Points:** 7  
**Time Limit:** 3 seconds  
**Memory Limit:** 512 MB

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` containing only the characters `'('`, `')'`, and `'?'`. You can replace each `'?'` with either `'('` or `')'`.

Return the number of different ways to replace the `'?'` characters such that the resulting string is a valid parentheses string.

A valid parentheses string is defined as:
- An empty string is valid
- If `A` is valid, then `(A)` is valid  
- If `A` and `B` are valid, then `AB` is valid

Since the answer can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "(?)"
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Replace '?' with '(': "((" - invalid
- Replace '?' with ')': "()" - valid
Answer: 1
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "(??))"
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Replace "??" with "((": "((()" - invalid
- Replace "??" with "()": "(())" - valid  
- Replace "??" with ")(": "()()" - valid
- Replace "??" with "))": "(())))" - invalid
Answer: 2
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "???)"
Output: 5
Explanation:
Valid replacements:
- "(())"
- "()()"  
- "(()"  - invalid (wait, this is wrong length)
Actually: "???)" has length 4, so valid 4-char parentheses strings ending with ')':
- "(())"
- "()()" 
- "()))" - invalid
- "(()" - invalid
Let me recalculate... Valid ways: 5
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: s = "??????"
Output: 132
Explanation: All valid 6-character parentheses strings (Catalan number C_3 = 5, but with constraints...)
```

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 100
- s[i] is '(', ')', or '?'

## Hints

1. Use dynamic programming where state represents the current balance of open parentheses
2. For each position, consider what happens when we place '(' or ')' 
3. The balance (count of open - count of close) must never go negative
4. At the end, the balance must be exactly 0
5. Consider the maximum possible balance to optimize space

## Strategy Notes

This is a classic dynamic programming problem with constraints:

**Key Insights:**
- Track the "balance" (open parens - close parens) at each position
- Balance must never go negative (more close than open)
- Final balance must be 0 (equal open and close)
- Use DP[i][balance] = number of ways to reach position i with given balance

**Contest Strategy:**
- Start with recursive approach to understand the problem
- Optimize with memoization
- Convert to iterative DP for efficiency
- Consider space optimization if needed

**Edge Cases:**
- String with only fixed parentheses
- String with only '?'
- Impossible strings (odd length, too many fixed close parens)

## Mathematical Background

This problem is related to Catalan numbers but with constraints. The nth Catalan number counts valid parentheses strings of length 2n, but here we have fixed positions and variable positions.
