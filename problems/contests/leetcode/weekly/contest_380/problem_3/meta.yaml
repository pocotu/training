solution_approaches:
  - "name: "Greedy Analysis"
time_complexity: "O(n)"
space_complexity: "O(1)"
description: "Recognize patterns based on array composition"
key_insights:
  - "Operations create cascading effects that must be analyzed"
  - "Arrays with both 0s and 1s offer more flexibility"
  - "Parity of operations affects final state"
  - "Mathematical analysis can replace complex simulation"
common_mistakes:
  - "Not considering cascading effect of operations"
  - "Overthinking the operation sequence"
  - "Missing edge cases (all 0s, all 1s)"
  - "Not recognizing the mathematical pattern"
learning_objectives:
  - "Understand cascading operation effects"
  - "Practice mathematical problem analysis"
  - "Learn to identify optimal strategies in constrained systems"
contest_strategy:
  - "Start with small examples to understand operation effects"
  - "Look for mathematical patterns rather than simulation"
  - "Consider edge cases early"
  - "Focus on the invariants of the operation"
