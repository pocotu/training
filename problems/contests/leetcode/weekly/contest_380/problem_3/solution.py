LeetCode Weekly Contest 380 - Problem 3: Maximum Binary Array After Change
https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-380/problems/maximum-binary-array-after-change/

Array / Greedy / Bit Manipulation Problem
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Key Insight: Analyze the cascading effect of flipping operations.
When we flip a bit, we must also flip all bits with the same value.
This creates connected components that determine the final state.
